I(@OVAnechka) thought I can do better, so I decided to do some modifications. That's how I got ver. 1.1: addition of Russian-English language switch, and ver. 1.2: refactored counter to a 4-direction shifter;\r\n\r\n#### Long story short\r\nI decided to help myself with other tools in my work of a circuit engineer:\r\n* ver. 2.0: CRC calculator, \r\n* ver. 3.0: Ping tab, \r\n* ver. 4.0: Multiply-to-shift function tab;\r\n\r\n#### Git\r\nStarting from version 3.0 I created a GitHub repository for my toolkit and pulling it here. Just for fun, actually.\r\n\r\n#### Recently\r\n* ver. 4.1: added CRC16 function to a CRC tab;\r\n* ver. 4.2b: added Pastebin API to notepad menu, added \"no internet connection\" exception.",
